        <hr>
        <h5 class="text-success text-capitalize">Biodiversity is all the different kinds of life you'll find in one area—the variety of animals,
          plants, fungi, and even microorganisms like bacteria that make up our natural world. </h5>
        <p>Biodiversity is essential for the processes that support all life on Earth, including humans.
           Without a wide range of animals, plants and microorganisms, we cannot have 
           the healthy ecosystems that we rely on to
           provide us with the air we breathe and the food we eat. And people also value nature of itself.</p>

        <h5 class="text-success text-capitalize"> do you know There is a wide variety of naturally 
          derived drugs which still serve as important therapies in medi­cine today. </h5>
        <p>and this all are obtainded from natural plants which are very endangered and
           The conservation of biodiversity throughout the world is of 
           significance for the mankind and indeed to the constancy of the whole world.
            The vast genetic variety available in terrestrial plants, animals and micro-organisms
             offers a wealth of possibilities for the betterment of mankind in the production of 
             foods and medicines </p>

        <hr>
        <h5 class="text-success text-capitalize"> as we know technology is a biggest gift of 21st century  </h5>
        <p> we will use drones, sensors, cameras, low-power radio networks,
           and satellite technology can remotely monitor wildlife 
          behavior and habitat changes in real time, tracking and monitoring the environment
        and  we will give seeds to some farmer which have some medicinal value and is on the state of extinc and 
        it will give them one more way to earn </p>

        <h5 class="text-success text-capitalize"> do you know herbal medicine is used by many people still 
           Herbal medicine has been commonly used over the years for treatment and prevention of 
          diseases and health promotion as
           well as for enhancement of the span and quality of life.</h5>
        <p> The Global Herbal Medicine Market Size Was Valued At USD 151.91 Billion In 2021. The Market Is Projected To Grow From USD 165.66 Billion In 2022 To USD 347.
          50 Billion By 2030, Exhibiting a CAGR Of 11.16% During The Forecast Period. 
          and if we will use that endangerd plant which have mediinal value
         if take ex of  brazil it has 50,000 trees which 
         are endangerd and half of them are medicinal tree The economy
          is a middle income developing mixed economy. In 2022, according
           to International Monetary Fund (IMF), Brazil has the 10th largest
            gross domestic product (GDP) in the world and has the 8th largest
             purchasing power parity in the world.

        <hr>
        <h5 class="text-success text-capitalize"> everything has pros and cons</h5>
        <p>  risk in my idea is that sometime plants grow according to the demand due to natural calamities .
          2.cameras and drones might not be working 
          3. climate and geographical problem with the plant

        <hr>
        <h5 class="text-success text-capitalize"> solutions for protecting biodiversity will 
          be planting tree or stop poaching animals</h5>
        <p>  but my solution is using technology ,not harming enviorment and also not harming social value.
           my solution will not only bring palnt live back
          but also many endagerd birds back and animals . if we  take exampel 
          of dodo he got extinct because tree 
          leaves which they used to eat are not not  anymore present in enviorment.
